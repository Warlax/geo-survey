# Introduction #

This is a school project for class COMP 595OSE - Open Source Software Engineering at Calstate Northridge.

The aim of our internet application is threefold:
1.  Allow surveyors to create online surveys.
2.  Allow survey-takers to take the surveys from geolocation enabled devices, mobile phone, desktop computers, etc.
3.  Allow surveyors to analyze the answers to questions based on the location of the survey-taker.

We will use HTML5 to gather the geolocation of the survey taker and the Google Maps API to plot the survey results.
